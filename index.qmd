I am a statistical physicist in the final year of my PhD in the lab of Prof. Luca Giuggioli at the University of Bristol. 
Before that I completed an MEng in Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol.

In general, I am interested in non-equilibrium statistical physics, with 
a key interest in developing new theory for discrete search processes. My <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=k4cP2HkAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=10389243673639785577&oi=ao">research output</a>
is generally mathematical, however to supplement this I write many stochastic 
simulations. With this, I am interested in the fast implementation of stochastic 
simulations, with my programming language of choice being Julia.

For a glimpse into my research, check out the poster below:
