**Authors:** ***D.M.***, Luca Giuggioli 

**Journal:** New Journal of Physics, 26, (2024)


**Summary:**  
Here we present an exact analytic framework to quantify search processes for the one-step memory extension of the random walk - the non-Markovian perisistent random walk. The theory is general and applicable in arbitrary dimension, with any boundary condition. This may find application in active matter, mathematical biology and movement ecology.

**Summary:**  
Here we present a review of the latest advances in the field of search in heterogeneous and bounded lattice random walks. It was an absolute pleasure to work with such a lovely team.

### <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.107.054139">Exact spatiotemporal dynamics of lattice random walks in hexagonal and honeycomb domains</a>
**Authors:** ***D.M.***, Seeralan Sarvaharman and Luca Giuggioli 

**Journal:** Physical Review E, 107, 054139, (2023)

**Summary:**  
Here we develop a general theory to exactly describe diffusive processes in hexagonal geometries. We consider two lattices, the coordination number six hexagonal lattice and the non-Bravias coordination number three honeycomb lattice. Random movement on 
hexagonal structures is seen as a modelling tool in varying applications from exciton transport on the surface of carbon nanotubes, to animal foraging theory.
